%POSQINTEGR   POSQ controller for differential drive robots
%   [XVEC, VVEC] = POSQINTEGR(XSTART, XEND, DIR, DT, B) generates
%   and returns the trajectory which brings a differential drive robot
%   with wheelbase B from the start pose XSTART to the goal pose XEND.
%   Calls the control function POSQSTEP every DT seconds.
%
%   Where:
%   xstart : 3x1 initial robot pose vector [x; y; theta]
%   xend   : 3x1 goal pose vector [x; y; theta]
%   dir    : direction of motion (1 forward, -1 backward, 0 automatic)
%   dt     : time in [s]. Control frequency is 1/dt
%   b      : wheelbase of robot
%   xvec   : robot trajectory. 3xn matrix of n 3x1-poses
%   vvec   : 2xn matrix of wheel speeds: left (1st row), right (2nd row)
